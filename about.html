						<span class="">Joy Karp was born and raised in Ottawa. She attended Carleton University graduating in 1971.
							Joy and her husband moved to Kingston Ontario where Joy taught at St. Lawrence College in both the Business and Communications Departments. She also worked for the City of Kingston. Recognizing Joy’s outstanding work and her ability to get through to people, several local business people fought to steal her away from the City. In what was to become a life changing decision, Joy chose to work for the Owner-Operator of the local McDonald’s Franchise. At the time he had just acquired his second Store. Joy helped him expand to five Restaurants.
							During the late 1970’s McDonald’s suffered from high staff turnover. The challenge came to Joy to alleviate the turnover in her area. Joy created the McDonald’s Hands-On Business Training Program, which not only reduced the turnover in the area, but also contributed significantly to the McDonald’s system worldwide. It was within that program that the concept of Promote From Within evolved. As well, during this time Joy studied Interpersonal Process Recall at Michigan State University. Her understanding of how people interact, how they learn and what they need to grow in their jobs, had a profound influence on her career. As well, during this time her understanding that service goes beyond serving customers, but comes to the core of human interactions, was fueled.
							During her many years in the Kingston and area McDonald’s system, Joy created and taught several intensive courses related to Service and Customer Satisfaction, including Human Relations, Leadership, and Listening & Communication. She was responsible for Marketing as well as building staff through training and development, and contributed to amazing sales growth, and staff retention.
							In 1984 Joy and her husband were accepted over hundreds of other applicants to become McDonald’s Owner-Operators.  Joy and her Husband accepted an offer by McDonald’s in1985 and moved to Whitehorse Yukon to introduce McDonald’s to the North.  During her close to 14 years as an Owner-Operator Joy won many Service and Customer Satisfaction awards, including several “Thinking Like a Customer” Awards, plus the prestigious Gold Hat Award, a tribute to her own communication and human relations skills. Additionally, she was awarded many 'Oustanding Store Awards' and one of the highest honors of all, the 'Ronald Award', as one of the three top Owner-Operators in Canada. However, to Joy, the greatest honor was serving Customers on front counter or in Drive-Thru whenever she could and when she did, she was a shining example and an inspiration to all of her Teammates.
							As well, local organizations awarded Joy the Employer of the Year award. To this day Joy receives “thank you” recognition from many previous employees for the positive influence she has had on their lives, still seeking her guidance and support. 
							Due to unforeseen illness, Joy and her husband sold the McDonald’s Franchise in 2000.
							In 2002 Joy and her husband opened Hair Sensations, a Beauty Salon in Whitehorse that includes a highly skilled Team of Hair Stylists, a tanning facility and a retail beauty products store , which they still own and operate. Joy’s enthusiasm for service excellence has been passed on to and delivered by all who work in the Salon.  Customers repeatedly comment on the level of service they receive from every employee at Hair Sensations--now a leading Salon in the Yukon. 
							In 2005 Joy responded to an advertisement from the Whitehorse Chamber of Commerce seeking expertise to create and teach a Service and Customer Satisfaction course in preparation for the Canada Winter Games of 2007. Joy won the competition, wrote the in-depth course, 10 modules, and taught it for the next year and a half to more than 40 businesses and hundreds of employees.  The feedback was extremely positive but Joy had to take a breather as she was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer. Once she had completed an operation, chemo and radiation treatments, Joy helped create a program called “Raising Our Game”, wrote an orientation Service and Customer Satisfaction brochure, and designed other tangible customer service tools for businesses. The brochures and other tools sold out--one more step towards a greater understanding of the importance of service excellence to a community and beyond.
							Finally, realizing that there needed to be a “new” approach to building Service and Customer Satisfaction,  the next step was obvious--to write a book about Service. Joy wanted it to be unlike any other book she had read on the subject.
							"THE POWER OF SERVICE--Service Through the Eyes of Customers"--was published in January of 2014.
							By the time Joy began writing her book in January of 2013, she not only had a wealth of first-hand service experience, she had proven in both of her businesses that she had an innate understanding of service excellence. She also had collected a journal full of service experiences, which her students had recounted in her many courses. Known for several decades as 'walking her talk' when it came to service, those who knew Joy cheered her on during her writing period.
							Joy has made significant, impactful contributions to individuals and businesses. She fights tirelessly to raise the bar on service, and to change old, outdated methods and attitudes. She has been called “a service warrior”. Her fight for service excellence continues through her new book, THE POWER OF SERVICE.  Her unconventional approach to the subject carries insights which surpass the old adages about the meaning of service excellence. 

							Some Unusual Experiences:

							In 1970, while giving birth to her twins, Joy suffered the first of three heart attacks. Four years later she had a serious car accident that took 18 months to recover from. She taught on crutches during that time but lost the normal use of her left foot.  In 1981 Joy waa diagnosed with congenital heart disease and it was discovered that she had five blockages in arteries supplying blood to her heart. Since she was too young to go through open heart surgery, her condition was controlled by medications. In 1992 Joy was kidnapped and buried alive in her car for close to 18 hours. In 1993, because of the trauma from the kidnapping, Joy had to have a Quadruple By-Pass--open heart surgey, followed up 4 months later by a major operation on her left foot, which was further damaged by the kidnapping.  Soon came depression and the biiggest battle of her life....to become the positive person she had always been. In 2008 Joy was diagnosed with breast cancer and within eight months she was cancer-free--another battle won.

							Joy refuses to compromise her ideals, regardless of the many challenges she has had to overcome. Although she sees herself as an ordinary person--there is nothing ordinary about Joy E Karp.

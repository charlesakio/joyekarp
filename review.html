							<p> I've read Joy's book and highly recommend it. I think Joy may have been reluctant to share the link to her book on Amazon. But, as a thank you for her continued participation in this group I'm happy to share the link for her: http://www.amazon.ca/The-Power-Service-J-E-Karp/dp/0993654703.</p>

							<p> "Joy Karp takes a different approach then the traditional author in exploring and recommending what excellent customer service is and should be. The way that she writes this book keeps you engaged and makes you want to read on. She truly does take you on a journey through the excellent to less than wonderous experiences that we all have in our everyday lives. I have shared this book with other members of my team and I look forward to their feedback and the value that they get out of this read. If you have not read this book yet and you are in any customer service industry you must read it!"</p>

							<p>Quoting from the book itself, "Storytelling is one of the oldest form of communication.", I would say that the author presented her great ideas in this book in the form of a story. 

The escapades of Monica and Josh will teach us the value of customer service and what it is like to receive one. Initially I was perplexed whether I would categorize this book as a business one or a novel. Due to the lessons in this book, I resolve to put it in my business shelf. 

If part of your job is to serve customer needs, you need to read this book. It is very entertaining and full of great ideas. I would say that the great ideas in this book are not unique. However, what makes this book unique is that fact that it was delivered through the form of a story. Just like how Professor Sidney say of the presentation of Monica and Josh, this book has full of "meat and bones with a good dose of seasoning". </p>

							<p>J.E. Karp has done what so many authors of "how-to-serve-clients-better" books and manuals have tried to do and failed. The author has created a engaging story of two students working to identify what good service means to the client, the recipient. The relationship between the two main characters in the book tells the reader a great deal about communication. Through their eyes you see the outcome of good service and of bad service. The situations are realistic, and the writing captures the reader's attention. The book is motivational as well; when you are finished reading "The Power of Service," you realize how much power you have to make another person happy and satisfied with your service...and all this without reverting to the usual point form service manual that is boring and anti-motivational. Read this book to get a head start on what service really is--positive communication between the server and those served. I highly recommend the book for those who have clients, customers, even patients. After reading it, you should also be able to generalize good service into a way of life. </p>

							<p>What I like most about this book is the allegorical technique it uses to take the reader on a relaxed journey as it gradually reveals the keys to providing outstanding service.

Before I go on, I should admit my bias. I know and greatly admire this book’s author, Joy Karp. She and I worked together for over 15 years as we built my McDonald’s Restaurant franchise operations in Eastern Ontario from 1 to 5 units. Joy and her husband went on to open their own, hugely successful McDonald’s in Whitehorse in the great Canadian Yukon Territory. She has enjoyed further success in the hotel consulting and beauty care fields. Joy has lived great service. She knows her stuff. There, I feel better. Now, let’s get on with my review.

The fictional characters (Josh and Monica) turn a business school project into a transformative odyssey that exposes them to the full spectrum of customer experiences, most of which we have lived ourselves – from bad, even abysmal, to exemplary. Along the way, the two friends (and the readers) stumble upon the key to truly understanding the core of great service – that looking at service, not from the provider’s view but from the customer’s, will create the all-important feel that informs and drives all the service steps that follow. This rings true with me. They realize that they must first embrace the concept of customer-driven service. After that, the service steps fall easily into place. As a result, they make a personal commitment to execute the type of service that will inspire customers to make return visits and to tell friends about their exceptional treatment.

Joy’s choice to communicate her secrets in a storytelling mode gives us the important information in bite-size, easy-to-digest chunks. What a great way to learn lessons.</p>

						<p> This was a fun book to read. The author imparted valuable information in such an interesting way. Even though I am not in the service industry, I really enjoyed reading it because, after all, I am still a customer! I loved looking at both sides of the coin, from the consumer's angle and from the seller's. There were many times when I could identify with either Josh or Monica's (the main characters) situations, having been in a similar one myself. In a way, it validated my experiences and feelings!

I found it very easy to identify with Josh and Monica as they fulfilled the obligations of the assignment. The characters were very natural and had a wonderfully honest relationship.</p>
